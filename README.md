## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

Most of my knowledge of front end development is from the Frontend Web Development course on FreeCodeCamp. See the link below

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first solution creating responsive design. I learned a lot about using flexbox. This was also my first solution doing form validation, and I learned a lot about that as well.

### Continued development

I plan on continuing my learning of responsive design using flexbox and also making more complex interactive web pages using event listeners and JS.

### Useful resources

- [Frontend Web Development Bootcamp Course (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJSY8tbf_ys&t=59708s) - Amazing course from FreeCodeCamp. Zach is a great teacher and developer.
